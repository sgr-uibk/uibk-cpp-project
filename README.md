# Game Specification

We describe a simple 2D networked multiplayer game.

We have a top-down view of the world, players are tanks or similar vehicles, they have health and can shoot projectiles.

There are obstacles on the map, some of them are destroyable, others not.

At first, there is one gamemode, where all players join a lobby, the game starts when all players are ready.
In the match, players shoot each other until the last one survives, who is the winner.

The players have health (shown in a healthbar).

Maps are predefined, stored in files like explained in the metroidvania specification example.
